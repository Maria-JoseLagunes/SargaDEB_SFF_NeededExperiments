Repository attached as suplementary material for the paper : 
"Most needed experiments to understand holopelagic
Sargassum spp. growth : How a multi-reserve DEB
model helps to design new protocols" 

- Sargassum_fluitans : Codes to create figures of estimations for Arrhenius parameters and model parameters. 
- Stylized_facts : Codes to create Supplementary figure of Stylized facts for Sargassum and other algae
- SargaDEB_tools : Miscelanous functions used throught the codes created or develop by authors or modified from the DEBtool M used for this version.
- Identifiability : Codes to do the identifiability analysis and to create the figure on the paper

To run a numerical simulation run the main.m file and to modify parameters, forcing variables or initial conditios use the initi.m file.
